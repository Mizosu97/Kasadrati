# Kasadrati

Arabic: قصضرتي

Latinized: qaṣaḍaratī

English: Kasadrati


Kasadrati is an Arabic keyboard layout designed for standard Latin QWERTY keyboards that do not have Arabic glyphs printed on them. Arabic key placement is dictated by how that specific Arabic letter relates to the Latin letter shown on the physical keyboard, as well as the letters around it. This ensures a semi-uniformity between Latin QWERTY keyboard layouts and Arabic keyboard layouts.
